# Shop for hardware

Todo
- Create a form for what requirments the user has (price, time, quantity, location)
- Create charts of what parts are needed in a project (react flow)
- Create a RAG system that finds the best parts for a project online (LLama 3.1, crewai, perplexity, claude)
- Click on Nodes to get benefits or drawbacks of the part

- Create a shopping list 
- Create an agent to order the parts online
- Create a Gantt chart of the parts
- Create a chart that shows the connection of the parts

Bulk buying collaboration
See what parts are missing and how long it will take to get them

Fine tuned on building an FPV drone

Focus search on forums like for fusion or fpv blogs. rank the blogs by neurodivergency. The more neurodivergent the better.
